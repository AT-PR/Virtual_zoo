Code-A-Haunt (24 hours Hackathon) project of virtual zoo.
CBP 40: Virtual Zoo
Design software and hardware to display holograms of existing and extinct species of flora and fauna to depict complex ecosystems from various parts of the world. The virtual zoo could be displayed in schools, museums, and Ministries without using much physical space. 
The zoo could also hold educational sessions about the environment within the virtual space using pre-recorded videos of teachers from around the world.

Project Ideas:
1. We're working on the prototyping idea of a hologram in form of a website first to make a virtual zoo for smart education purposes.
2. This would effectively help new genration to learn and study about diffrent species of flora and fauna with help of technology.
3. We're developing a responsive and interactive website that would firstly focus on diffrent ideas of teachers from all around the world giving the live experience of animal livelihood living all around the globe.

Flow Chart:
1. Brainstorming the ideas
2. Website prototyping
3. Embedding Live Web Cams from diffrent wildlife sanctuaries and national parks
4. Developing learning environment for students
5. Going with the flow.
