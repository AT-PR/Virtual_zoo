CBP 40: Virtual Zoo
Design software and hardware to display holograms of existing and extinct species of flora and fauna to depict complex ecosystems from various parts of the world. The virtual zoo could be displayed in schools, museums, and Ministries without using much physical space. 
The zoo could also hold educational sessions about the environment within the virtual space using pre-recorded videos of teachers from around the world.
